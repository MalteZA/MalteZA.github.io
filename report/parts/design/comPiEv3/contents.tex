% file for writing the contets of the communication between EV3 and Pi chapter (can be deleted later)

The EV3 to Pi communication chapter should map out how the communication between the two devices works. 
This includes diagrams of the modules aswell as what modules communicate with each other. 
It should also mention that the communication happens through a USB-cable, 
this shouldn't be detailed (like using sockets) as that is implementation (this part could be moved to implementation if it fits better).
