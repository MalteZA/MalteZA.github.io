\chapter{Optimal Solution}\label{ch:optimalSolution}
This chapter is meant for framing our take on the best possible hardware and software for us to work (and experiment) with.
The word \textit{optimal} should therefore not be seen as a carefully measured selection of resources, but rather as a greedy pick, had money and time been no problem.
By that logic, anyone referencing this report (perhaps while doing a similar, but more ambitious, project) might find useful suggestions for hardware and software in this chapter.

The chapter ends with a summary of the most essential features of the greedily picked materials, which will help when evaluating the actual hardware and software we will have access to.
