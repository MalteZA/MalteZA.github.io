\section{Essential Features}\label{sec:essentialFeatures}
Having looked at the possibilities for choice of hardware and software, the following features from each section will be held in mind when choosing from the provided selection we have access to.

\subsection{Hardware Features}\label{ssec:essentialFeaturesHardware}
A common theme from the hardware described is that they are all designed and pre-built to a point where our job is to do final assembly, and then dive straight into the software design.
This can be seen on the chassis from Traxxas containing all needed components for creating a rough idea of a car, it can be seen on the Jetson Nano being a complete system in itself (with official accompanying operating system and frameworks), and it can be seen on the webcam from Logitech ready to installation via a common USB type A plug.

\subsection{Software Features}\label{ssec:essentialFeaturesSoftware}
The software had two common themes worth mentioning: reuse of existing solutions, and easily accessible tools for building a new solution.

Given the needed hardware, we acknowledge the existence of solutions made with both scientific and commercial goals, and deploying those would indeed get us to the finish line for this project.

By taking the suggested Jetson Nano into account, and thereby making the hardware the limiting factor (instead of the software), the choice points more in the direction of pre-built frameworks and tools for us to experiment and work with.
