\chapter{Actual solution}
In \autoref{ch:optimalSolution}, an analysis of the optimal setup for a solution was conducted without any restrictions to what was possible in terms of limitations for this project.
This chapter will instead approach a more realistic solution compared to what is actually possible to do.
Firstly, an analysis (and choosing of) the hardware will be conducted, after which the possible operating system for the chosen platform will be examined.
