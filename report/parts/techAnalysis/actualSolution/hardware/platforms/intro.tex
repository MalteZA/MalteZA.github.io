\subsection{Platforms}\label{ssec:platforms}
The hardware platform would be the main component in the system, as it would run the application, and control all other components, in terms of reading their output and giving them input.

The criteria on which the platform is chosen, which will be further described in \autoref{ssec:choiceOfHardware}, are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item By default the platform should be able to, without any unauthorized changes to the motor or the platform \footnote{Unauthorized changes means no soldering, cutting wires, open up a part that is not meant to or any other such altering.}, control motors.
  \item The platform should be able to read input from a camera.
  \item The platform need computing power, because one of the tasks of the software being developed is to process images. This processing must be done relatively fast, since the car cannot stop and wait for the processing to finish.
  \item The platform needs to be accessible wirelessly.
\end{itemize}
