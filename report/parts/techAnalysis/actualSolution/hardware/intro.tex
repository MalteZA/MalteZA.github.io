\section{Hardware}\label{sec:actualHardwareIntro}
The first part of the analysis of a more realistic approach for a solution deals with the hardware for the car.
This section will explore the different options for platforms, motors, and cameras in terms of what is available from either Aalborg University or what we own ourselves.
This analysis of the different parts will create the basis for a selection of the components which will be described at the end of the chapter.

This chapter contains specifications of LEGO parts, in order to identify the exact LEGO part referred to, the title with the LEGO part name will also include the design ID of the specific LEGO part being described.
The design ID is the LEGO part's unique identifier without referring to a specific color \cite{lego_identifying_legoparts}.
