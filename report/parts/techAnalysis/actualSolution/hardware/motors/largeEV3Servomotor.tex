The EV3 large servomotor, which can be seen in \autoref{fig:sssec:EV3LargeServomotor}, is a servomotor within the LEGO MINDSTORM universe.
It is the most powerful lego motor available which, through its built-in rotation sensor, allows for precise control down to an accuracy of one single degree.
The servomotor spins at a maximum of 160-170 rotations per minute (rpm), and is powered and connected through its RJ12 port.
The servomotor works as default on both the LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 brick, as well as on the LEGO MINDSTORM NXT 2.0 brick \cite{lego_lego_EV3NXTCompatibility}.
