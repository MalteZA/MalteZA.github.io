\subsection{Cameras}\label{ssec:cameras}
For the system to be able to get a visual input about its environment, a camera is needed.
There is only one camera available which will be described in this subsection.

Even though only one camera is available, it must still comply with the following criteria:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The camera must be able to connect through USB.
  \item Must have a decent resolution, however, it does not have to be high.
  \item The camera must have a wide enough field of view, both horizontally and vertically, such that the it can provide sufficient information about the autonomous carâ€™s environment.
\end{itemize}
