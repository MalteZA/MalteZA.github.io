\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:introduction}
Autonomous vehicles or self-driving cars are one of the hot topics in today's car industry as well as in the general media \cite{self_autonomous_cars_finally_here, driverless_Cars_Are_Hot_topic, Autonomous_future_}.
The technology has improved over the last 10 years, however it has been an active point of interest for researchers and companies alike for a much longer time.
Already in 1925 the first attempts at autonomous driving began, with a radio-controlled car with no one behind the steering wheel \cite{digitalTrends_milestonesSelfdriving_2019}.
In the 1980s, successful attempts at making self-driving robots were made at the Carnegie-Mellon University, where the robots were able to avoid obstacles and follow roads \cite{wallace_roadFollowing_1986}.
In modern day, several industry giants have made their contribution to the field, among these are Google and Tesla.
Google started working on a self-driving car project called Waymo in 2009, and, as of July 2019, it has driven autonomously for over 10 million miles in the real world and 10 billion miles in simulation \cite{waymo_homepage, waymo_drivenTenBillionMiles}.
Tesla has also been pursuing the development of fully autonomous vehicles and Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, has proclaimed that they will be ready with a self-driving taxis by the end of 2020 \cite{boudette_elon_2019}.

Humans have always pursued technologies to make life more convenient for them, of which self-driving cars is one of them, however, there are several other benefits, besides conveniences.
One of these is the potential avoidance of traffic accidents.
Cars and taxies are the top contributors to fatalities in traffic accidents, up to 47\% are caused by these in Europe \cite{annual_accident_report_2018}.
The most common cause of traffic accidents is timing errors, where up to 51\% of car accidents were caused by the failure of humans to respond in a timely manner in the traffic \cite{thomas_identifying_2013}.
A closer look on Great Britainâ€™s cause of accidents, show that a very common issue leading to accidents is simply that the driver is not orienting properly when driving a car \cite{statista_roadAccidents_2019}.
